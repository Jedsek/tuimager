# tuimager
It is a tui image viewer based on kitty/iterm graphic protocols.  
For Chinese, you could view [my blog](https://jedsek.xyz/categories/rust-tui) about using ratatui-rs to write this simple project.  

**Note:**  
Your terminal should support kitty/iterm graghpic protocols like `kitty/wezterm`.
